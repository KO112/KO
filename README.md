To-Do List:

- Create sample data, names from mtcars
- Add hash to GLM Helper (based on sorted formula?)
- Filter/select model matrix (e.g. partial column matching, etc.
- Make mode_stat ignore blanks
- Check if client can run on own computer, check address of client on server, check if running server from own computer works.
- plotly tests for BDP
- replace_missing: fix for factors (relevel?)
- Finish compare_df testing (test with dates, one col date one character, messages, etc.)

Data Dictionary:
- Make class for single column summary, and a list of them(?)
- For printing, change from tibble to something easier to read in bulk, maybe multiple columns
- Add colHash, maybe use constructor for both colTables/colHash
- Change message to crayon::green
