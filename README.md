# To-Do List:

- Check if client can run on own computer, check address of client on server, check if running server from own computer works
- Add hash to GLM Helper (based on sorted formula?)
- Create sample data, names from mtcars
- Filter/select model matrix (e.g. partial column matching, etc.
- replace_missing: fix for factors (relevel?)
- Select function to match columns, case/columns insensitive
- Head/tail assignment (`head<-`, `tail<-`)
- Allow select.matrix to accept variables (e.g. `a <- c("mpg", "cyl"); select(as.matrix(mtcars), a)`)
  - Maybe use `with = F` or just search up if not found, or implement `..a`
- Build file/function calling map
- compare_dfs: print message if identical, or all.equal, or no differences
  - Don't just return empty list
- Pretty JSON printing (takes in CSV file, aligns values, adds colors(?))
- .DollarNames(dataSet, "pattern")
- knitr::knit_code
- Create new RMarkdown template
  - Remove some CSS, maybe improve TOC section
- Use progress bars
  - E.g. for `compare_dfs`
- Finish `color_list`

## XGBoost Output Analysis:
- Feature importance graphs
- Feature interaction analysis

## Variable EDA:
- Distribution based on type
- Histogram, plot, smoothed plot
- Quantiles/averages

## Add-Ins:
- Printing selected variable
- Showing option values (what does this even mean?)
- Use `menu` instead for selections
- Make DLL specifically for activating/moving tcl/tk window, maybe faster?
  - Or load once and activate somehow?
- Add end bracket at next comma
  - Extend to quotes & other characters as well
  - Use general function, parameterize later
- Pop-up to select column names
  - Maybe full preview popup, (semi-)random sampling of rows?
- Capitalize previous word (loop through upper/lower/title case)
- Move left/right until you hit a comma/bracket/etc.
- Code cleaning
  - RCpp code cleaning function
    - Deal with quotes/comments differently
  - Print comparison/differences in color, similar to Git?
- For chunk running, run block-by-block
  - Also create block-run shortcut
  - Run in proper directory for .Rmd files
  - Run current line if no selection
  - Check for errors (maybe using `.Last.value`?)
  - Trim empty lines at start/end
- Find functionality with history saving (save in git repo too?)
- Remove current/previous/next enclosure
  - E.g. remove everything in enclosing quotes/brackets/etc.

## Data Dictionary:
- Make class for single column summary, and a list of them(?)
- For printing, change from tibble to something easier to read in bulk, maybe multiple columns
- Test new values in dataDict
- Add colHash/colMode, maybe use constructor for all col(...)
- Progress bar (progress::progress_bar)
- .DollarNames


# Tests:
- plotly tests for BDP
- Finish compare_df testing (test with dates, one col date one character, messages, etc.)
- Printing
  - `Indent` in vec_print
- `set_comp`
- All add-in functions (specifically text removal, send to console, formatting)
  - Test that lines with spaces removed are the same
